This plugin installs a sidebar widget that can show the upcoming events from a Google Calendar feed.

== Description ==

This plugin installs a widget for showing a Google Calendar agenda on the sidebar.
Once installed it adds a sidebar widget called 'Google Calendar' that may be dragged into your sidebar.
Each widget can be configured with a ID of the calendar feed, a title, and the number of agenda items to show.

The calendar feed ID is the ID next to 'Calendar ID:' in the Google Calendar settings.

Multiple widgets can be used on the same page and each one can reference a different feed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Google API Key? =

1. Go to <a 'href=https://console.developers.google.com'>https://console.developers.google.com</a>.
1. Create or select a project for your web site
1. In the left sidebar, expand <b>APIs & auth</b> then select <b>APIs</b>
1. Change the status of the <b>Calendar API</b> to <b>ON</b>
1. In the left sidebar, select <b>Credentials</b>
1. Click on <b>Create new Key</b> and choose <b>Browser key</b>
1. For testing purposes you can leave the referrers empty, but to prevent your key from being used on unauthorized sites, only allow referrals from domains you administer.


= Where do I get the calendar id? =

See the here for more information about how to find your calendar key (http://googleappstroubleshootinghelp.blogspot.ca/2012/09/how-to-find-calendar-id-of-google.html).

= How do I change the language of the dates =

You can [download localized versions of date.js from here](http://code.google.com/p/datejs/downloads/list).  Find the correct language version in the "build" folder of the zip file, and replace the date.js in the plugin folder.

= How can I change the format of the dates and times =

The date and time is formatted using the date.js library.
Look for code like the following two lines in ko-calendar.js and change the format argument to match the format you want.

	startJSDate.toString("ddd, MMM d, yyyy h:mm tt")
	dateString = startJSDate.toString('MMM dd');

The formatting represents how the information will look on the page "MMM" translates to the abbreviated name of the month.
 
Take a look at the documentation for how you can change that formatting string to match what you want.
http://code.google.com/p/datejs/wiki/FormatSpecifiers
 
For example, you can change the following

	dateString = startJSDate.toString('MMM dd');

to this

    dateString = startJSDate.toString('dd.MM.yyyy');

to change the agenda item "Jan 2" to "02.01.2009"

= Why is HTML in my calendar entry getting mangled =

The plugin uses the [wiky.js library](http://goessner.net/articles/wiky/) that generates HTML from a wiki-like markup language.
It expects that the calendar item descriptions are marked up using that format.  This is done to simplify the formatting for users who are already familiar with wiki markup and make the calendar entries easier to read when not interpreted.

If you wish to remove this transformation simply replace the following line in ko-calendar.js

	bodyDiv.innerHTML = Wiky.toHtml(entry.description != null ? entry.description : "");

With

	bodyDiv.innerHTML = entry.description != null ? entry.description : "";

= How do I insert this in a theme without a sidebar =

NOTE: After the V3 API upgrade this may not work correctly.

You can insert the widget into a template directly, without adding it to a sidebar, by inserting php code directly into your theme.

	<?php
	the_widget("WP_Widget_KO_Calendar",
		array(
			'title' => 'Calendar Title',
			'url' => 'yourcalendar@gmail.com',
		),
		array('before_widget' => '<div class="calendarwidget">',
			'after_widget' => '</div>',
			'before_title' => '<div class="calendartitle">',
			'after_title' => '</div>'
	));
	?>

You can configure it with the same options available in the widget, as the second parameter to the_widget.

* 'title' will appear at the top of the calendar.
* 'url' is the id of your Google Calendar (see the Installation instructions for more details)
* 'url2', and 'url3' allow you to specify multiple calendars to be shown in the one view.
* 'maxresults' restricts the number of events to show.  The default is 5.
* 'titleformat' is the format of the event titles.  The default is "STARTTIME - TITLE".
* If 'autoexpand' is TRUE, the calendar will show the details of each event by default.  The default is FALSE.

The third parameter lists the standard widget options.  See the wordpress Widget documentation for more details.
They can each be blank (i.e. 'before_widget'=>'') or contain whatever formatting you desire to be inserted in the flow.

= How do I customize the event titles? =

The "Event Title Format" option for each calendar allows you to format how you wish the calendar events to appear in the event list.
The default format is "[STARTTIME - ][TITLE]" so, for example, an event that starts at 6:00pm would called "Birthday Party" would appear as "6:00PM - Birthday Party".

*	[TITLE] will be substituted with the event title.
*	[STARTTIME] will become the start time (or "All Day" if it is an all day event).
*	[ENDTIME] will become the end time (or blank if it is an all day event).

Any extra characters included within the [] will be inserted if the value exists.
That is, [ENDTIME - ] will insert " - " after the end time, if and only if there is an end time.

If an event is an all-day event, then [STARTTIME] will be replaced with "All Day" and no [ENDTIME] will defined.

All html tags are stripped except `<br>` and `<p>` tags.

Examples

*	`"[STARTTIME] - [TITLE]"`              becomes `"6:00AM - Test Event" or "All Day - Test Event"`
*	`"[STARTTIME] - [ENDTIME - ][TITLE]"`  becomes `"6:00AM - 9:00AM - Test Event" or "All Day - Test Event"`
*	`"[STARTTIME][ - ENDTIME] : [TITLE]"`  becomes `"6:00AM - 9:00AM : Test Event" or "All Day : Test Event"`
*   `"[STARTTIME][ - ENDTIME]<br>[TITLE]"` becomes `"6:00AM - 9:00AM<br>Test Event" or "All Day<br>Test Event"`

= Can I use this code outside of Wordpress in an HTML page? =

Yes!

I have included an example with the plugin in "examples/stand_alone.html" that shows an example using the plugin code.
Each element is tagged so it should be flexible for styling; see the existing stylesheet for examples.
You must replace the text 'YOUR API KEY HERE' with your Google API Key

== Screenshots ==

1. The widget showing the upcoming Google developer calendar events on the sidebar of the default Wordpress theme.

= 1.4.6 = 
* Added definition of ko_calendar_loc if it was not previously defined by the wordpress loc system to support stand alone pages.

= 1.4.5 =
* Made URL of apis.google.com protocol relative so it will work with secure sites
* Added initial support for localization and an en_US localization database.  I will include user contributed localizations.
* Added support for `<br>` and `<p>` tags inside of the title format to get more formatting options.  For example "`[STARTTIME][ - ENDTIME]<br/>[TITLE]`"

= 1.4.4 =
* Clearer error message if using an invalid API key.

= 1.4.3 =
* Replaced WP_PLUGIN_URL with plugins_url for better compatibility
* Fixed typo in php which broke the Google Console URL in the settings screen
* Added error handling to batch query (it returns success even when parts of the batch fail, so we have to now check for individual errors).
* Entry will now expand with the time and location even if there is no description.
* Removed some unused code.

= 1.4.2 =
* Use Google client API batching to query multiple calendars
* Added support for comma delimited calendar ids.  You can now add multiple calendars in one entry by separating them with commas.
* Maintained the 3 ID entries for compatibility, but the second and third fields will likely be deprecated in the future and replaced with a single comma delimited list.

= 1.4.1 =

* Corrected the timezone for the all-day events

= 1.4.0 =

= 1.3.2 =
* Optimizations:

* Removed the script includes from the admin interface.

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed problem where spaces around the loading GIF caused it to not stop when the calendar loads.

= 1.3 =

* Added error checking for errors that can occur when used offline (for test servers).
* Changed the layout of the widget settings to increase the size of the text boxes.

= 1.0 =

This is a required upgrade to the Google Calendar API V3.  Versions prior to this stopped working November 17, 2014.
You must replace your Google Calendar URLs with just the calendar ID (for example "1234@google.com").
You must also get a Google Api Key and save it in the new plugin settings page.

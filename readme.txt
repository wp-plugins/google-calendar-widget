This plugin installs a sidebar widget that can show the upcoming events from a Google Calendar feed.

== Description ==

This plugin installs a widget for showing a Google Calendar agenda on the sidebar.
Once installed it adds a sidebar widget called 'Google Calendar' that may be dragged into your sidebar.
Each widget can be configured with a URL of the calendar feed, a title, and the number of agenda items to show.

The calendar feed is the URL you get when clicking on the XML icon next to 'Calendar Address:' in the Google Calendar settings. See the full instructions here.

Multiple widgets can be used on the same page and each one can reference a different feed.
